# How to run YOLOv7 on NVIDIA Deepstream

Instructions for executing the official [YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) on NVIDIA Deepstream.

## 1. Export the Model

The [YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) already has a method for exporting a trained model to an [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) format which can be run like this:

```
python export.py \
--weights ./yolov7-tiny.pt \
--grid \
--end2end \
--simplify \
--topk-all 100 \
--iou-thres 0.65 \
--conf-thres 0.35 \
--img-size 640 640
```

This command will create an ONNX model with an [efficientNMS](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/tree/main/plugin/efficientNMSPlugin) (Non Max Supression) node inserted. Care should be taken to ensure the parameters `topk-all`, `iou-thres` and `conf-thres` are configured correctly for how you want to execute your model. See the [efficientNMS](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/tree/main/plugin/efficientNMSPlugin) README for further details.

## 2. Update the Custom Bounding Box Parser

At time of writing, NVIDIA does not support parsing the `efficientNMS` output format into the correct data structure for Deepstream [NvDsObjectMeta](https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/sdk-api/struct__NvDsObjectMeta.html). We are in progress of donating this code to NVIDIA so it can be included in the Deepstream releases by default so this step may not be required in future.

To be able to map the model outputs from `efficientNMS` to the NVIDIA `NvDsObjectMeta` data structure you need this code has been added in `/opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-6.1/sources/libs/nvdsinfer_customparser/nvdsinfer_custombboxparser.cpp`. A copy of this modified file exists in this repository that you should use to replace the file in that directory.

Once replaced, run `make` in the `/opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-6.1/sources/libs/nvdsinfer_customparser` directory to compile the library with the new function.

## 3. Update your nvinfer Configuration

You then just need to make sure your [nvinfer](https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/dev-guide/text/DS_plugin_gst-nvinfer.html) stages point to the correct custom library and function like:

```ini
parse-bbox-func-name=NvDsInferParseCustomEfficientNMS
custom-lib-path=/opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-6.1/sources/libs/nvdsinfer_customparser/libnvds_infercustomparser.so
```

# Common Problems

## numClassesConfigured Assertion

Messages like this indicate that at least one of the detections had a class id larger than the `nvinfer` configured `num-detected-classes`. The solution is to update `num-detected-classes` to the correct number of classes for your model.

```
Assertion `(unsigned int) p_classes[i] < detectionParams.numClassesConfiguredâ€™ failed.
```
